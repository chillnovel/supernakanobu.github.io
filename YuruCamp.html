Why does the work "Yurucamp" attract people? I think that this work shows a kind of "antithesis" in the "relationship between people" as seen in conventional animation. In recent years, as "diversity" has been called out, the trend of how people interact with each other is changing. People are becoming more interested in life from "relationship with friends" or "mass" to "individual" or "solo" life. It can be said that an individualistic way of life has adapted to the times rather than living with a group or friends. In the highly information-oriented society, people have acquired "anonymity". It can be said that anonymity accelerates individualism. However, this trend has not started in recent years. In the post-war economy, getting "my car" and "my home" was a milestone in his life. It was a society where it was worthwhile to get such a private space. Both my car and my home strengthen people's anonymity. It can be said that "private" and "anonymity" have brought about the fact that people become bullish when they are in a car and that human relationships are weakened in emerging residential areas. Individualism and anonymity can be said to be "modern people whose consideration for others has disappeared" from a pessimistic point of view. On the other hand, it can be said to be an "antithesis" to conventional societies such as "a society in which individuals are respected" and "a society in which there is no need to be bound by human relationships". A character called "Shima Rin" appears in Laid-Back Camp. She doesn't like to act in groups. On the other hand, "Kakamigahara Nadeshiko", which is the opposite character to Shima Rin, is a person who can be understood by anyone and actively enter the circle of people. She, of course, plunges into Shima Rin with a similar glue, but is rejected at first (still unrelenting). Rin Shima goes to the camp alone, and the beginning of the story shows her resistance to the Nadeshiko group "Outdoor Activities Circle". She gradually becomes acquainted with Rin Shima as a member of the "Outdoor Activity Circle", but there is still a depiction that Rin Shima normally camps solo. In other words, Laid-Back Camp is a world in which humans with high communication skills such as dianthus and "modern" and "individualist" humans such as Rin Shima coexist. Isn't this a human relationship that hasn't been expressed in anime so far? It is an expression that can be taken as an "antithesis" to the human relationship of "relationship with friends" in the conventional "mass". And what cannot be overlooked is that it is possible to express "Synthese" in which Nadeshiko and Rin Shima coexist with a good sense of distance in the work.
