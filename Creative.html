    Creative industry: Free trade or protected market?

   <br>
    
    Introduction
    All over the world, cultural works appeals people and represents national identity. They have been playing crucial role. Nowadays, digital creative industry is becoming popular among young generation. For example, Finland is the one of the leading countries of the mobile game industry. However, creative industry contains controversial issues between free trade or protected market. I consider that this issue is emphasized with growing internet and globalization. J. P. Singh argued that nowadays, information technologies are considered crucial to develop cultural industry. (Singh, 2010, p.4) Internet make easy to spread creative works such as movie and game with Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Steam and many other services. Jeffrey A. Hart referred that in the US, digital media have already been major inroad against the analog alternatives. (Singh, 2010, p.61) Growth of digital cultural and creative industry also stimulates presumption field. People became easy to make fun art or added value to original art works. In my opinion, YouTube and Twitter and many social networking services plays important role to promote prosumption. In my opinion, we can consider prosumers as a new sort of “artist” because they play roles of cultural observers, receivers and producers. Thus, they understand specific cultural values and have ability to make added value. For example, some people love both of reading comics, and making fun art. They receive cultural effect from comics, observe them and produce fun arts. Therefore, these activities are artistic to some extent. However, these growths also made easy to access creative works even illegally. There is problem about ignoring copyright and illegal uploading especially YouTube. 
    In addition, growth of internet and globalization have a possibility to strengthen “Hollywoodization.” Nowadays, we can access huge enterprise’s products so easily with YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon. Obviously, it affects creativity in small countries. As we discussed in the second lecture, trademarks and potent can protect huge enterprise’s works, but small indigenous is difficult to access to these rights without some organizational helps. So, there are necessity of some sort of restriction or structural amendment to protect small creative cultures. How can society allow and regulate free trade and protected market? 
    Thus, nowadays, information technologies are unavoidable topic when discussing free trade and protected market. On this essay, I will focus on creative industry especially digital creative one. Which is the best choice to introduce recent free trade or protected market in the creative industry? In addition, I will also argue cultural policy which impose on digital creative industry.

    UNESCO effort
        UNESCO and so many organizations have been playing important roll between free trade and protected market. According to J. P. Singh opinion and our lecture, UNESCO doesn’t have a strong power to enforce their policy to countries. However, they can generate testifies important issues in global politics. In addition, he also pointed out market liberalization by huge global corporation is seen as destroying local small culture. On the other hand, he suggested that market and exchange might increase cultural diversity. (Singh, 2010, p.10) Therefore, market liberalization and free trade include both of positive side and negative side. It might bring negative outcome to developing countries on the aspect of diversity of local small culture. Hegemony of Hollywood destroys small movie culture. On the other hand, market and exchange also make some sort of diversity. For example, these effects can be seen on the internet. I consider that, presumption culture is one of the typical diversities which is caused by cultural exchange on the internet. One of the important roles of UNESCO is protecting cultural diversity. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.1) Thus, I will focus on UNESCO’s works for culture. 
    GATT and WTO made effort to enforce liberalization of global market and some countries tried to start protecting their national rights sometimes with UNESCO. In addition, cultural products are regarded as “cultural exception” because they are special significance and national identity. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.3) Thus, there are duel between GATT, WTO who want to promote free market in the global market and UNESCO who want to preserve national identities and cultural diversity. Sometimes I can recognize these issues as disputes between United States and other countries. Especially, the 2005 UNESCO convention was mainly European response to American attempt for free trade of culture. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.6) Thus, we can observe that United States are very strong actor even in the cultural market. And I agree with the main concept of “cultural exception” because cultural products represent local lifestyle and inherent value. Sometimes cultural free trade stimulates local culture positively such as glocalization. On my perspective, fusion of different cultures and making new value can be seen as a positive effect of glocalization. I think that Finnish Sauna has been also glocalized all over the world. It adjusts local atmospheres and plays expected role. Interior and functions are depending on native atmospheres. These glocalize effect stimulates both countries’ economy positively. 
    On the other hand, cultural free trade contains possibility to constitute hegemony by huge enterprises such as Hollywood. It affects cultural diversity and sometimes tries to make cultural homogeneous world. However, there are another perspective that aim of protectionism and free trade are same thing. Both of them are wanting to maintain and increase cultural diversity. It makes sense because I can exemplify glocalization and presumption as success of free cultural trade. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.6) I consider that important point is keeping balance between protectionism and free trade. Especially, crucial issue is protecting cultural minority’s works and small company’s products. One of another important issue is that UNESCO’s convention contains largely western understandings of how promote and protect cultural diversity. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.9) When we consider African small tribes’ culture and indigenous customs, they would not have same value priority as western countries. So, respecting and understanding those culture and considering how can they regain national identity by dividing from previous colonial powers are also important.
    On my perspective, we must respect cultural diversity. Thus, conservative aspects and treaties are required. On the other hand, cultural exchange brings positive stimulant to local culture. It deserves to allow free cultural market to some extent. Coexistence of protecting national identity and stimulant to local culture would make better both of cultural diversity and economy.

    Development of digital creative industry
    In this chapter, I will discuss positive effects and risks caused by high networked information technology society. Véronique Guèvremont referred that development of digital technology plays a role of providing possibilities for cultural creative works and spread them. However, there is a risk of increasing leaving specific culture behind and imbalance between rich and poor countries. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.148) In my opinion, nowadays, considering information technology and networked society is crucial things for protecting and promoting cultural diversity. In the lecture, “Hollywoodization” was dealt. They are some risk of making world movie market homogeneous. It emphasizes capitalism and make dominant in the global market. Especially, nowadays, internet plays important roll to convey those movies to other countries. However, small creative company and individuals can’t compete on the aspect of advertisement and resources. 
    On the other hand, these changes may bring many positive outcomes. They stimulate people to be prosumers. Nowadays, social networking service spread around the world. Thus, individuals are also becoming to be able to create something and post their works on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. Bjarki Valtysson stated that Web 2.0 platform offered prosumers to participate, produce, consume, and distribute digital products. (Singh, 2010, p.70) Users make added value to original products and post them. These are one of the creative activities. In addition, social networking service made people easy to be artist. These service offer spaces to post user’s work which include also made by prosumers. Nowadays, artists are not only professional artists, but amateurs and hobbyist also can become artist to some extent. 
    On the other hand, Bjarki Valtysson referred much of prosumptions are taking place illegally. He exemplified YouTube video. When prosumers make their works, it has a possibility to ignore copyright. So, traditional cultural policy can’t control these situations. (Singh, 2010, p.73) I also can apply this issue as question of “Free trade or protected market?” because internet and service for prosumption is not regulated. Thus, it is like free market. For example, people can make illegal production which ignore copyright and make money from these products. In addition, as Bjarki said, traditional method can’t prevent those issues. Nowadays, technology is growing continuously, thus uploading illegal things on YouTube become difficult. Even though, new cultural policy and regulation which is adjusted to internet society is required. I referred duel between free trade and protected market. The new controversial place for discussing between free trade or protected market is on the internet. Huge popular Social Networking Services are often operated by United States’ enterprises. Thus, even nowadays, United States hold strong power on the internet culture. Regardless nationality, all people can use these services and be prosumers. On the recent highly networked information society, all citizens have possibility to be artist. Certainly, some poor countries and not networked societies are less possible to yield artist on these services. However, nowadays, nationalities are relatively less affected component to be artist especially prosumers. 
    I will focus on this point more specifically. Véronique Guèvremont referred “digital divide” issue. So, she argued protecting and promoting cultural diversity are related to infrastructural development which enables people to access to internet. (Pyykkönen, 2015, pp.150-151) I totally agree with her opinion. Developed countries have been already highly networked. However, developing countries are not. Without constituting worldwide accessible equality, highly networked society just strengthens developed countries’ economy and creative industry and remakes economic inequality.
     Véronique Guèvremont states that UNESCO convention must take place with understandings of dematerialization and digitization of traditional cultural offer. That’s because the emergence of new technology and mode. (Pyykkönen, 2015, p.147) Certainly, networked society and information technologies are constantly changing, so treaty and common acknowledge must be revised continuously. 
     <br>
    Conclusion
    Nowadays, digital intellectual property is also important right on the informalized and globalized society. Not professional citizens can be creative artist as a prosumer on the recent networked information technology society. Therefore, new treaty which can protect digital creative product and potent is needed. Proper extent free trade stimulates creative industry positively and promote diversity. On the other hand, protecting weak and small creative product maker from domination of market by huge enterprises is crucial issue. Well controlled balance between free trade and protected market are required even recent highly networked information technology society.
