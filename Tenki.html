<h1>
  The new definition of "Otaku" thought from "Wethering With You"(En)
</h1>

  <div class="centering-block-inner">
<p>
    Audience mobilization 10 million-The latest film by director Makoto Shinkai, who started screening in July and recorded an exceptional long run and box office revenue. There are many excellent stories on the net, so I don't have to write them. Besides, when I saw the weathering with you, I couldn't feel the kind of thought that was unified there. Rather, various ideas are mixed too much, and it is impossible for me to extract and document them. Therefore, in this note, I would like to write about how I felt subjectively with the weathering with you.

The note itself, and this article itself, is my self-sufficiency. It takes some courage to publish self-sufficiency online. However, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described the work controversy on the Internet as "toilet graffiti." I like this expression. I had a blind belief that work theory was originally a noble act that was performed after deeply understanding the ideas of the author and the social situation that existed in the background. However, in his expression, the consideration given by the recipient of the content has no social meaning. It's a graffiti-level obscure thing in the toilet. With that in mind, the hurdles for considering the work are very low. The work of publishing it on the net in this way is the same.

--- Below, including spoilers ---

Is Weathering with You content for otaku? The following two points were especially memorable for this work.

1. Outright jumping at the core of the story

2. Natsumi An expression with a hand stain like "You saw my breasts"

Is it a depiction where the evaluation of likes and dislikes is divided and "nerd-likeness" exudes? Since the number of spectators has exceeded 10 million, it is thought that many people who do not usually watch anime have come to see it. (Although the actual numbers may differ because there are some people like me who go to see it multiple times.) What is an otaku in the first place? Earlier I mentioned two points about otakuness. In other words, in more concrete terms, the former is "Can you accept the unreality for the progress of the story?" The latter is "Can you be pleased with the clichéd expressions often used in anime?" right.

1. Outright jumping at the core of the story

so. The story of Weathering with You is crazy. The realistic depiction of Tokyo and the contrast between the human pattern and the Sekai story are also good for this work, but some people may not accept the jumping condition of this story. I think that accepting or not accepting the jumping condition of this story will be a tool to judge whether it is a kind of "otaku". One of the significant differences between many dramas, non-fiction and anime is the "sci-fi" that is difficult to express in live-action. Any expression is allowed because it is a picture and two-dimensional. It does not have to follow physics extremely, and it is possible to express delusional techniques that cannot be reproduced in reality at all. Innumerable depictions that ignore science appear in the work of Weathering with You. Whether you like this expression depends largely on the person. In watching anime, we have to accept expressions that transcend science, and otaku unconsciously accept these expressions. Is the delusion with high science fiction completely meaningless because of the complacency of the artist? I don't think so. Just as Jules Verne, a writer known for 20,000 miles under the sea, said, "What humans can imagine can always be realized by humans," the genius writer SF foresaw the science of the future. Is an undeniable fact. Among the secret tools that appeared in Doraemon, there are many that we use on a daily basis as a matter of course in modern times.

2. Natsumi An expression with hand stains such as "You saw my breasts"

I think many people dislike this expression of the latter. In the first place, the character Natsumi itself seems to have been made by gathering male ideas, so there are many people who feel potential discomfort. However, I think this expression is necessary, and it is a factor that guarantees that this movie is an anime movie, and it is an important expression that asserts that it belongs to subculture. "You saw my breasts" is a clichéd expression that has been used many times from traditional anime works, and the appearance of this expression means "planned harmony." A stable expression that is sure to appeal to the humorous layer. However, it is a double-edged sword that creates a certain kind of "feeling" for men. Wouldn't it be better if this expression wasn't there? Without this expression, Weathering with You would have to be a truly "general-purpose" work. I'm an otaku, so when I look at "general-purpose" works, I feel like I'm not resting. Rather, the sense of security you feel when consuming content for nerds is similar to the sense of security you feel when you take a nap at home. Geeky expressions are tranquilizers and watchwords that have the effect of making geeks geeky and reassuring.

in conclusion

This time, I took up the expression that appeared in the weathering with you and thought about what "otakuness" is. I think that "whether you can accept the story's jumping condition" and "whether you are pleased with the planned harmony" are important indicators. However, this work that keeps the nerdness was widely accepted by people in the world because of the overwhelming attention to detail, attention to expression, and the wave of excitement for a kind of template-like last scene. Probably because it was included. Compared to Hayao Miyazaki's work, Makoto Shinkai's work has a very different personality. It is worth further consideration here.
