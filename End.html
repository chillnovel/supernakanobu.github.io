  End of The History and New Ideology
  <br>


  
  
   Kojeve analyzed that in the universal homogeneous state, there are no contradiction which human history always contained. On the other hand, American philosopher, Francis Fukuyama published essay about the end of history based on Kojeve’s works in 1989. He reinterpreted thought of Hegel and Kojeve. And this philosopher made his own idea which describes the end of history. I was strongly interested in the concept of the end of history and Fukuyama’s analysis. Hegel, Kojeve, and Frances Fukuyama argued about end of the history to some extent. According to interpretation of Fukuyama, we can regard liberal democratic society as the end of the history. He argued there are no alternatives which have possibility to concur liberal democracy. Nowadays, Soviet style communism is already out of date. Obviously North Korea is isolated in the global society. Which ideology is more rational and can be survived in the future? Is liberal democracy the most superior regime? Is there a possibility of appearance alternative regime in the future?
  In this essay, I will discuss these author’s thought about end of history and analyze between theory and history. According to Fukuyama’s article, the concept of the end of history is not original. Some grate philosophers have already implied them. What is the end of ideological conflict? Marx defined completed socialism will bring us the end of history. 
  Firstly, I will discuss interpretation of the end of history from Hegel, Fukuyama, and Kojeve. Then, I will argue that how can we recognize our contemporary world based on the perspective of the end of history. American style liberal democracy changed and influenced many other countries like Japan after world war Ⅱ. Also, America interevent Korean peninsula. Contemporary United states with Donald Tramp achieved many diplomatic negotiations with recent North Korea. I will also focus on how liberal democracy effected other non-liberal democratic states. And in this essay, I will argue their thought and effect of liberal democracy. Afterward, I will discuss which regime is the best for the end of history. Afterward, I will propose one regime as new social system of synthesis. In my opinion, Nordic style welfare states is synthesis which is one of the alternatives of contemporary liberal democracy. It can be explained by Hegel’s dialectic. It is not completely new regime, but only extension of liberal democracy. But welfare states which have high redistribution system solves economic inequality that is mentioned one of the problems in liberal democracy and capitalism by Fukuyama.

  Hegel’s thought about the end of history
  Hegel used the phrase of “end of history” in lecture on the philosophy of history. Europa is facing end of history and Asia is only facing beginning of history. Hegel and Sibree (2001, p. 121) argued about difference of East world, Greek and Roman world, and German world as “The East knew and to the present day knows only that One is Free; the Greek and Roman world, that some are free; the German World knows that All are free.” Then, Hegel regarded Asia as region which contains only strict imperial states. Japan and China and other Asian country used to be imperial states before end of world war Ⅱ. Especially Japan, during world war Ⅱ, they were strict imperialism. So, in Hegelian context, only Japanese emperor was free, but other citizens are not free. It was true. Japanese emperor was “God” until end of world war Ⅱ. However, after world war Ⅱ, Japan shifted liberal democracy. Also, in Fukuyama’s opinion that Japanese liberty in politics and economic influenced other Asian country who stand opposite position of this idea. Then, some Asian countries were changed from imperial states as “only that One is Free” to liberal states as “All are free.” It was happened because western, especially American liberal democracy influenced Asia. Hegel mentioned west is the end of history and east is beginning of the history. His thought seems to tend to Pan-Germanism, but in the historical perspective, it makes sense to some extent. Fukuyama states American style liberal states as universal homogeneous states. It raised in the west, but not from Germany. Afterward, it spread to east. Thus, liberal democracy born in the west, and they got the end of history earlier, afterward this regime influenced east. 
  <br>
  Fukuyama
  Fukuyama reinterpreted concept of the end of history. And his main idea in “The end of history?” is that liberal democracy defeated other ideology and spread all over the world even Japan and German which was sort of fascism during world war Ⅱ. He mentioned obviously liberal and political liberalism won after world war Ⅱ. Japan was imperialism before end of world war Ⅱ. Then, American liberal democracy defeated Japanese imperialism and GHQ reformed Japanese political system from imperialism to democratic society. After that, Soviet which was socialism experienced self-distraction. Then, many countries took a stance of liberal democratic system. Our world didn’t have new world war after 1945 Therefore as Fukuyama’s thought, liberal democratic state is superior proved. However, Fukuyama’s thought has possibility that denial for other ideology. For example, I came up with Hungarian attitude. In our last lecture, ambassador of Hungary gave us a lecture. In his lecture, he mentioned about CEU, Central European University. This university is affected academic freedom by government. Firstly, I thought it is incorrect. However, this thought is aspect of liberal democrats. I was born in Japan and have lived in there 20 years. Thus, democratic state is quite common in my consciousness. It makes denial of other political system and thought. Sometimes I consider that liberal democracy is absolutely justice. 
  And Fukuyama also mentioned about Marxism. Carl Marx argued that liberal democratic society also contains contradictions between capitalist and labor. However, Fukuyama states that liberal democracy has already resolved this problem. He exemplifies Kojeve’s perspective that egalitarianism in modern America as achievement of essential classless society. And he also mentioned that economic inequality is not caused by legal and social characteristics but historical legacy of premodern society. In his opinion, poverty of African American in United States is “legacy of slavery and racism”. Thus, it is not the responsibility of liberal democracy and economy. 
  However, I consider that this analysis is too pessimistic and arrogant. Of course, this thesis was written in 1989, then, situation was so differed from contemporary world. Even though, I can say same things. “legacy of slavery and racism” is too pessimistic because there are no positive resolution and progress in this sentence. It put the onus on ancestor. Completed equality can’t be realized because each people have different ability and knowledge. However, economic gap can be alleviated by social redistributive system. Both of American style liberalism and soviet style communism couldn’t alleviate this problem. Nowadays, in liberal democratic states, proletarian revolution can’t be happened because their democratic and legal system have already developed. At least in Japan, proletarian revolution is quite out of date. Then, in my opinion, regime will shift slowly in legal way in liberal states. It’s highly unlikely that society suddenly change and shift to another regime like proletarian revolutions. But contemporary societies have possibility that shift another regime gradually. Huge war, like world war Ⅲ have a possibility to change regime rapidly like Japanese shifting to liberal democracy from imperialism right after world war Ⅱ. However, I believe that world war Ⅲ might not come at least over the next few decades because nuclear weapon has catastrophic power. In Japanese case, atomic bomb to Nagasaki and Hiroshima made an end of pacific war and world warⅡ. Also, it made japan imposing liberal society. Therefore, catastrophic war made them new regime, but nuclear war makes truly catastrophic consequence. Thus, it hard to occur. I believe nuclear deterrent.
  However, because of globalization, people can move freely internationally. Many labors and students can cross border easily compare to some decades ago. Then, regime shifts to more rational direction rapidly in globalizing world. People can flee if they deny their own country’s regime. So, new more rational regime become popular and old unpopular regime will be obsolete. However, problem of economic inequality has remained. At least moving to other country cost much money. Also, getting knowledge which is required to survive in other country cost much more money. Economic inequality affects getting opportunity of higher education. Then, knowledge inequality will be occurred. So, ignorance and poor affect also opportunity of free moving in the global society. Then, only rich people gain opportunity of free moving and ability of discerning rational regime for themselves. These inequalities are occurred even in liberal democratic society and free market. 
  Fukuyama also mentioned about Japanese economy. Indeed, after world war Ⅱ, United states imposed japan to become liberal democratic state both of political side and economical side. 
  He also argued that political and economic liberalism adjusted Japanese culture. Then, Japanese economy rapidly grew after world war Ⅱ. Then, Fukuyama states Japan followed American footprint and became universal consumer society. Indeed, Japanese became able to consume a lot of things after rapid economic growth. It is sometimes criticized by environmental, mental, and moral perspective. Of course, becoming consumer society is one of the indexes that can distinguish developed country or developing country. However, realizing consumer society is just one of components of happiness. Then, it sometime affects badly people mentality and environment. And consumer society make some sort of class system. Nowadays, huge enterprises can buy labor forces cheap price from developing countries and use them in bad work place. We can regard these systems as new class system in contemporary consumer society.

  The “end of history” 20 years later
  Fukuyama answered interview which is held by New Perspectives Quarterly in 2013, after over 20 years later publishing “The end of history.” In that interview, his opinion has remained that liberal democracy is final form of government. In those 20 years, many states have changed rapidly. For example, collapsing Berlin wall and Soviet Union, democratization of many Soviet side states, Gulf war, 9-11, Iraq war, etc. 
  All these movements are related to liberal democracy. Thus, Fukuyama’s prediction 20 years ago was sort of correct. Fukuyama also mentioned there are no alternatives arising in the world. Chinese style communism didn’t gain power as main regime all over the world. I can deserve that fact as triumph of liberal democracy. As Fukuyama mentioned in “The end of history?” that Japan contributed to influenced liberal democracy in Asian region. However, Fukuyama also mentioned liberal democracy and capitalism is not perfect system. He referred to huge global recession because of unregulated market. Global financial crises from 2007 hit America first, afterward, influenced all over the world. Ironically, origin of this recession was United states who influenced liberal democracy and free market. Thus, liberal democracy and capitalism is not optimal solution, but alternatives haven’t appeared in the world after world war Ⅱ. He argued that now, world faces democratic recession. He exemplifies Soviet who seems returning to previous system without law. Also, Venezuela who has populism regime. I can also add China and North Korea as examples. Many of eastern Europe who was once communism society and soviet side democratized in these decades. However, some states as described above haven’t been democratic states. They hold free market to some extent. However, political side is not completely liberal democracy. Especially, China and North Korea is still ruled by communist party. However, United states made effort to North Korean denuclearization. Last year, we got many surprising news from Korean peninsula. Panmunjom Declaration, destroying nuclear facility. Then, many people argue whether North Korea truly destroyed nuclear facility or not. But I will not discuss validity of these news. When I focus on the aspect of regime, we can regard these news as one of the victories of American style liberal democracy. North Korea got economic sanction by other states. I can also analyze that is pressure of liberal democratization. North Korea is also influenced by liberal democracy. They seem not collapse soon, but they have possibility of self-destruction or got reformed by other democratic country like Japan after world war Ⅱ. Fukuyama criticized appearance populism in Latin American states. However, same things go for recent United states after Donald Tramp appearance in political field. Presidential election showed us some sort of populism and chauvinism in United states. On the other hand, American style liberal democracy contributed reducing terrible genocide typified by under fascism Germany and imperialism Japan during world war Ⅱ. Of course, world war Ⅲ has not happened in these 70 years. Therefore, I can say American style liberal democracy has ensured basic rights at least one’s own life in liberal democratic countries. Liberal democracy has been proved as rational regime at least these 20 years. So, this fact ensure liberal democracy is very rational and strong regime in contemporary world.

  Kojeve
  Kojeve mentioned end of history as “the universal homogeneous state.” In his “introduction to the reading of Hegel”, homogeneous defined as free from internal contradictions, like from class strife, etc. Moreover, this state can not be changed any more because all of citizens are satisfied situations. Then, Fukuyama analyzed that liberal democracy is the end of history, in other words universal homogeneous state. It is correct to some extent. Of course, liberal democracy is not perfect regime, but other regimes have not been able to defeat liberal democracy after world war Ⅱ. And there has been no huge revolution in those developed democratic states. 
  He interpreted Hegelian “master and slave” theory. It expresses relation between slave and master, and how can they behave after slave become slave and master become master. Kojeve focused on behavior and thought of master. Master doesn’t have to work for other one. Then, they think they work for themselves. He argued that in these situations, master is also enslaved by capital. He only works for capital. Then, I can apply this theory to contemporary economic society. It shows us new perspective that everyone works for capital. 
  Nowadays, class society has been already abolished, but bourgeois and proletarian are remained as rich capitalists and poor workers. Globalization accelerate generating economical gap between rich and poor as I mentioned last chapter.

  Analysis
  In these days, developed countries takes a stance of liberal democratic society. In Fukuyama’s perspective, it is the best situation. Our world has not had huge war in these 70 years. Albeit there are some war including Iraq war. Also, we have experienced some crises during cold war. I can realize that terrorism is as challenge against democratic society. Many people died in these conflicts, even though we are enjoying peace. Starting world war Ⅲ is too much cost in the aspect of nuclear deterrence. If new world war initializes, then there is higher possibility of using nuclear bomb. It makes catastrophic consequence. So, states have few merits to start world war. Even though, some problems related to liberal democratic is remained in the democratic states. For example, economic inequality. Many countries which take stance of liberal democracy have issue of economical gap. Liberal democracy and economic liberalism have deeply related each other in contemporary period. After French revolution, economic gap as represented by rich and poor are remained. In the liberal democratic countries, class system had been removed, however some sort of class based on economic strength is remaining. It is like bourgeois and proletarian. Lack of fund make people restriction of possibility. For example, getting higher education including entering university, studying abroad, etc. Therefore, people who or whose parents has insufficient fund affect his choice in the life. They will have complaint. I can predict that these new sorts of class bring bad consequence. I can’t say proletarian make revolution against bourgeois like Marxism. Socialism countries was destructed in modern history. Soviet collapsed in 1991. North Korea is also espousing communism. But I can’t say North Korean people enjoy enough economic, politic rights and freedom. 
  We can regard contemporary liberal democracy and economy as thesis in Hegelian dialectic. On the other hand, I can consider that economical gap as antithesis Then, what is synthesis? I consider that new model ideology which contain possibility domain all over the world is Nordic style welfare states. I want to regard Nordic style welfare states as synthesis. Right now, it is seemed that Nordic welfare states got succeed. For example, in Finnish case, student can enter the university for free and do not have to pay tuition. It is combination of liberal democracy and socialism. Nordic countries are well known as better welfare redistributor. On the other hand, these welfare states are also liberal democratic society. I can regard their social system as new synthesis. But they are not completely new regime. They are only extension of liberal democracy and socialism. 
  There are no new regime which arise recently and has a possibility to concur liberal democracy in the world. Thus, I can admit some sort of Fukuyama’s argument. In His analysis, liberal democracy can be dealt as synthesis, but I can’t regard contemporary liberal democratic states as universal homogeneous states. History will develop more in the future. However, basic liberal democracy can’t be changed. As I mentioned above, extent of redistribution can be changed as Nordic states. So, if world trend of regime and social system will shift to become welfare states like Nordic states, we can’t regard this incident as huge regime crises or defeat of liberal democracy. These shifts require liberal democracy. Liberal democracy will be regarded as presupposition of contemporary states. Therefore, liberal democracy can’t be defeated by other regime, but redistribution can grow in liberal democratic societies.
